// digestHashLen is how many hex characters of the sha256 the short fingerprint

// different fleets negligible for this purpose while staying glanceable on one
// line — it is a change-detector, not a cryptographic commitment.

// Digest returns a stable fingerprint of a selection's repo SET: the repo count
// plus a short hash over the sorted "owner/name" full-names. Sorting makes it
// order-independent, so two selections covering the same repos — regardless of
// the order discovery happened to return them — produce the same hash. It covers
// only the repo identities, deliberately not branch-presence or provenance, so
// it answers exactly the question WS6 poses: "same N repos?". An agent can
// compare two digests to confirm a selection is unchanged without reading the
// whole lockfile back.
// SelectionBytesDigest is the full sha256, hex-encoded, of the exact bytes of a
// lockfile. Unlike Digest — a short fingerprint of the repo SET, meant for a
// human glance — this commits to the whole file content (every field, exact
// formatting), so it is the file's identity, not a semantic summary. It backs
// `apply --expect-selection-sha256 <hex>`: bind a real run to the precise
// lockfile a plan was reviewed against, and refuse if anything changed. Callers
// should feed it the same buffer they parsed (see ReadWithDigest) so the digest
// and the parsed selection cannot describe different content.
