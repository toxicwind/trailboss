# Reproducible-build verification: rebuild a released tag from source with the
# same toolchain and flags the release workflow uses, then print the sha256 so
# it can be compared against the published checksum. VERSION is required and
# must match the released tag exactly — it is baked into the binary via
# -ldflags -X main.version, and the embedded VCS stamp means you must run this
# from a CLEAN checkout of that tag's commit (see README "Verify a release").
# The build line also neutralises ambient Go env that would otherwise change the
# bytes and diverge from the release runner's defaults: GOFLAGS= (e.g. a stray
# -buildvcs=false would drop the VCS stamp), GOWORK=off (a go.work would swap
# deps), GOEXPERIMENT= (reset to the toolchain default set), GOAMD64=v1 (the
# release default; ignored off-amd64).
