# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository. (`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to
this file, so Claude Code reads exactly the same content — one source of truth.)

## Two audiences — don't confuse them

- **Operating trailboss** (running the CLI, in this repo or elsewhere): run
  `trailboss guide` for the operator playbook, or read `cmd/guide.md`. Do **not**
  rely on this file for usage. One convention worth knowing up front: when you're
  developing a fleet change, `mirror --purpose <name>` (optionally `--branch
  <b>`) into a fresh, timestamped `~/trailboss/<purpose>[-<branch>]-<stamp>`
  snapshot to read and test against — each run gets its own pristine dir,
  trailboss never deletes it, so you clean it up when done. `mirror` prints that
  resolved workspace path as a bare line on stdout (banners/ghorg output go to
  stderr), so capture it rather than globbing for the stamped dir. One gotcha:
  `--branch` and `--clone-depth` are incompatible (a shallow clone only fetches
  each repo's default branch, so `--branch dev --clone-depth 1` would silently
  skip `dev` wherever it isn't the default) — trailboss refuses the combo; omit
  `--clone-depth` when mirroring a non-default branch. Full recipe in
  `trailboss guide`.
- **Changing trailboss's code** (you are here): read `README.md` first for the
  product design and rationale, then follow the rules below.

## What trailboss is

An orchestration layer. It resolves a repo selection (org/user + topic), freezes
it as a JSON lockfile, then delegates: **ghorg** mirrors the selection locally,
**multi-gitter** applies changes and opens PRs. trailboss owns the *selection*;
it does not reimplement mirroring or PR-fanout.

## Hard rules

- trailboss **never writes to GitHub and never runs `git` itself.** Discovery is
  read-only REST; mirroring is ghorg; commits/pushes/PRs are multi-gitter. Adding
  a `git` exec or a PR-create call means you're reinventing a delegated tool —
  stop.
- A real (non-dry-run) `trailboss apply` opens PRs and must never happen on an
  agent's own initiative or by accident. `apply` defaults to dry-run; a real run
  additionally needs `--dry-run=false --confirm`. An agent may perform the real
  run **only when the human has explicitly authorized this specific fleet
  change** — and then must dry-run first, present the status digest, and prefer
  `--draft`. Absent explicit authorization, the real run is the human's to
  execute.
- `apply` requires `--sign` on **every** run (`local` = the operator's own GPG
  key via the git binary, `github` = GitHub's web-flow key via the API, `none` =
  unsigned) — there is no default. An agent must pass it explicitly and state
  which mode it used and that mode's trust model when presenting a dry-run or a
  real run; never silently pick one.
- The selection lockfile is authoritative: `mirror` and `apply` read it and must
  never re-run discovery — so "the repos I mirror" and "the repos I change" are
  provably the same set, which is the whole product. The `mirror` report is built
  from the lockfile alone (no `git`, no re-discovery): branch presence is a fact
  **recorded at selection time** (`select --branch-presence`) and can drift, so a
  branch never checked reports `unknown` — do not add code that guesses it.
- `trailboss scan` (cmd/scan.go, cmd/scan_search.go) is the read counterpart to
  `apply`: it searches the clones `mirror` already put on disk and never touches
  GitHub. It reads the **lockfile** for its repo set (never re-discovery) and
  searches **only** those repos under the workspace — the same provable-same-set
  guarantee applied to reads, asserted by a test that a rogue on-disk clone
  outside the selection is ignored. Keep it purely local: **no git, no network,
  no token** — the search is Go stdlib `regexp` (RE2) over files read with
  `os.ReadFile`. A selected repo not on disk must report `scanned:false` with a
  skip reason (never silently dropped); binary files and symlinks are skipped by
  design; a per-repo match cap or an over-size file skipped sets `truncated:true`
  so a bounded scan never reads as exhaustive. Do not add a REST/code-search
  content scan here — reading via the mirror instead of the API is the point.
- Tokens go to child tools via their env vars (`GHORG_GITHUB_TOKEN`,
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`), never argv. Tests assert no token appears in argv.
- `trailboss mcp` (cmd/mcp.go) serves trailboss's **read-and-plan** surface over
  MCP on stdio as thin adapters over the existing report cores (no logic of its
  own). It must stay read-and-plan: there is deliberately **no `apply` tool** —
  `apply_plan` returns the digest-bound `apply` command for a human to run, and
  `apply_plan` must never call `apply.Apply` (a negative test asserts it succeeds
  fully offline, with no token and no child tool). Do not add a tool that opens
  PRs or runs `git`. The StdioTransport owns the process's real stdin/stdout as
  the JSON-RPC channel, so no tool may write to them: delegate output is captured
  and token-redacted, never streamed. The go-sdk MCP dep was maintainer-approved
  for this (issue #58).
- The machine surfaces are self-describing and must stay honest: `guide --json`
  is the input catalogue (kept in sync with the validators by tests) and
  `trailboss schema` is the output contract — hand-authored JSON Schema for the
  lockfile and every payload, pinned to the Go structs by a golden file **and** a
  reflection test (`properties` = the struct's json fields; `required` = its
  non-omitempty fields). Change a payload's shape and you must regenerate the
  golden (`go test ./cmd -run TestSchema -update`) and keep the schema builder in
  step, or the tests fail — that coupling is deliberate, don't loosen it.
- Flat packages (`cmd/`, `models/`, `client/`, `discovery/`, `selection/`,
  `mirror/`, `apply/`); no `internal/`/`pkg/`. Tests alongside code, testify.
- Go module deps are pinned (cobra, go-github, testify); adding one needs asking.
  ghorg and multi-gitter are runtime CLI deps invoked via `exec`, checked on PATH.

## Before every commit

`go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...` clean — or just `make check`,
which runs build + test + lint, mirroring CI's `test` and `lint` jobs. `make
lint` runs golangci-lint (gosec + staticcheck) via `go run` at the version pinned
in the Makefile; the same version and `.golangci.yml` config drive CI. gosec
findings on the exec / temp-script / file surface are triaged in-tree: either the
code is hardened, or the call site carries an inline `//nolint:gosec // reason`
that documents why it is safe — don't blanket-disable a rule to silence one.
