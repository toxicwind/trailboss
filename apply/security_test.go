// securityTest marks a test (or fuzz target) as one that locks a security
// invariant of trailboss. It is a no-op at runtime; its only purpose is
// discoverability, so an auditor can list every security invariant test without
// trusting a curated list — grep the call sites (not the two `func securityTest`
// definitions):
//
//	grep -rn 'securityTest(t)' --include='*_test.go'
//
// Run just them:
//
//	go test ./... -run 'ShellQuote|StripsSourcePAT|OverridesExistingToken|RefusesUnconfirmedLiveRun|RequiresValidSignMode|SignMode|LocalSign|PinsEmptyConfig|Neutralises|PinsLayout|Invocation'
//
// The same one-line marker is defined in each package that holds security
// invariants (currently apply and mirror); keep the two definitions identical.

// maxFuzzToken caps the token length FuzzShellQuote will execute. The quoting
// logic is length-independent, so a few KiB exercises it fully; the cap keeps a
// very long fuzz string from hitting the OS argv limit (ARG_MAX/E2BIG) and
// failing the exec for a reason unrelated to quoting — a false failure.
const maxFuzzToken = 4096

// FuzzShellQuote proves the central injection defence: no operator-supplied
// token can break out of the quoting apply.writeScript applies before handing
// the command to multi-gitter. Rather than assert a property of the quoted
// *string*, it exercises the real assembly end to end — writeScript builds the
// actual `#!/bin/sh` script, a real POSIX sh runs it, and we confirm the fuzzed
// token reaches the program as exactly one argument, byte-for-byte, without
// merging into, displacing, or executing anything around it.
//
// The program under the script is /usr/bin/printf, invoked as
//
//	printf '%s\n' <fuzzed-token> SENTINEL
//
// so the output must be exactly "<token>\nSENTINEL\n". Any quote break-out would
// either corrupt the first line, drop/merge the SENTINEL word, or (the danger
// case) run an injected command — all of which fail the equality assertion.
//
// This is an argv-round-trip oracle under a real shell, not a full proof that no
// shell side effect ran: it observes stdout and exit status, so a *silent*
// command substitution wouldn't be seen directly. That's an accepted limit —
// the current shellQuote can't produce one, and any regression that let a
// substitution escape would also corrupt the round-trip and fail here.
//
// Blast-radius containment: `go test` (including CI) only ever executes the
// curated seed corpus below — all harmless echo-based payloads. Active fuzzing
// (`-fuzz`) generates unconstrained mutations, so IF shellQuote ever regressed a
// mutation could get a command substitution past the quotes. To keep that from
// touching anything real, each script runs with an emptied environment (`PATH=`
// only narrows ordinary PATH lookup — it does NOT sandbox: shell builtins like
// `kill`, `command -p`, and redirections to absolute paths can still reach
// outside), HOME and the working directory pointed at a throwaway temp dir, and a
// hard timeout so a hang can't wedge the run. Those reduce incidental damage but
// are not containment; the real guarantee is procedural — run active fuzzing in a
// disposable environment (throwaway VM/container), never on a real host.
