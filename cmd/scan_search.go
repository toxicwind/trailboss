// searchTree walks the repo clone pinned by root and returns every line matching

// and deliberately conservative about what it reads:
//
//   - the .git entry is skipped wholesale, whether it is a directory (a normal
//     clone) or a regular file (a gitfile-linked worktree): VCS internals are not
//     repo content, and a searchable gitfile would leak its internal gitdir path;
//   - only entries WalkDir reports as regular files are read; symlinks, devices, and
//     sockets are skipped. A statically-present symlink is therefore never followed.
//     (An entry actively swapped regular→symlink in the walk→open window could be
//     followed, but only WITHIN the repo root — os.Root confines every read to the
//     mirrored tree, so a read can never escape it; see searchFile.);
//   - files over maxFileBytes are skipped (and mark the result truncated);
//   - files containing a NUL byte are treated as binary and skipped (grep's default);
//   - the match list is capped at maxMatchesPerRepo (hitting it marks truncated).
//
// root is a directory handle the caller opened, confined WITHIN the workspace: it
// pins a descriptor on this exact clone, so every ReadDir and Open below resolves
// against THAT directory — immune to the path being swapped for a symlink after
// this point (the walk→read TOCTOU) — and io/fs refuses any symlink component that
// would escape the root. That makes "a symlink can never lead the read out of the
// mirrored tree" a property of the handle, not a per-file best-effort, and it is
// portable (no O_NOFOLLOW), so it compiles on every target.
//
// A walk error on an INDIVIDUAL entry (an unreadable file or subtree) is not fatal
// — one bad file must not abort the audit of an otherwise readable repo — but it IS
// a real gap in coverage, so it marks the result truncated rather than being
// silently dropped. A walk error on the ROOT itself is different: nothing was
// searched, so searchTree returns an error and the caller reports the repo
// not-scanned rather than a misleading scanned/0-match result. This matters because
// Root.FS() re-opens the directory to list it, so the root read can fail AFTER the
