// mcpRun executes a delegate tool in a way that is safe to call from inside the
// MCP stdio server. Three properties matter, none of which the streaming CLI
// runners provide:
//
//   - The child NEVER touches the server's stdin/stdout/stderr. Those are the
//     JSON-RPC channel; a byte of ghorg chatter on stdout would corrupt the
//     protocol. Output is captured into a bounded buffer instead, and stdin is
//     nil (a child that blocked reading it would deadlock the server).
//   - The child runs in its own process group and context-cancellation kills the
//     whole group (see setProcessGroup), so cancelling a tool call reaps the
//     delegate's grandchildren (ghorg → git) rather than orphaning processes that
//     keep running and writing after the call returns.
//   - Wait is bounded by killGraceDelay so a stuck child can't wedge the call.
//
// It returns the child's combined output (tail-truncated). token is redacted
// from the captured output — including across the truncation boundary, see
// boundedBuffer — so a secret can never survive in the returned bytes; pass ""
// when there is no secret to mask.

// while serving MCP, where a raw exec.Command().Output() would be unsafe: the
// context kills only the direct child, so a spawned helper/grandchild holding the

// through a single copier.

// redact, when set, is applied to the whole buffer immediately before old bytes
// are dropped. This is what makes secret-masking robust against truncation: a
// token that lands across the drop boundary would otherwise lose its front half
// to truncation and survive as an unmaskable fragment. Redacting while the token
// is still whole turns it into the fixed marker first, so truncation can only
// ever cut a marker, never split a live secret.
