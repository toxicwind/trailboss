// discovery: the lockfile (what was selected, and — for a requested branch —
// what presence was frozen at selection time) and a read-only filesystem check
// (how many of those repos actually landed on disk). It exists because ghorg's
// own "N new clones" line counts only *newly* created clones — a re-mirror of an
// unchanged fleet reports 0, which reads as "nothing there" — and because ghorg
// prints one "Could not checkout <branch>" line per fall-back repo, noise that
// scans as failure. This single line is the authoritative counterpart to both.

// match) can't be miscounted as covered on the one line marketed as the
// authoritative coverage truth. It stays within the charter: a read-only stat,
// never git. The .git entry is accepted whether it is a directory (a normal
// ghorg clone) or a file (a gitfile-linked worktree), so "is this a clone" is
// answered honestly without assuming ghorg's exact layout.
//
// The root must be a REAL directory, tested with Lstat: a symlink at the clone
// location — even one pointing at a valid git tree — is rejected. ghorg never
// creates one, so its only source is tampering or an unrelated symlink a repo name
// happens to match; counting it as covered would let reconcile claim coverage of a
// tree it never actually walked through the workspace. (scan makes the same "is
